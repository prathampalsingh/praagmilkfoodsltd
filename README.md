While developing the code, I encountered an issue related to dependency conflicts. Specifically, the framework was unable to recognize the @Valid annotation, likely due to a mismatch between the javax and jakarta packages.I understand that this was caused by a recent migration from javax to jakarta, and I am confident that reinstalling the dependencies with the correct jakarta versions will resolve this issue.
The remaining parts of the code are functioning as expected or at least not producing any errors. I am committed to resolving this dependency issue before the next interview.
